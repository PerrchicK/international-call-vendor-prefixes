# International Call Vendor Prefixes - the updated list
This repository holds the full list of international call vendor prefixes as one JSON object

There's a huge amount of vendors who supply a way to make international calls, each vendor has its own prefix therefore we get a huge amount of prefixes.
When it comes to a program that should parse phone numbers, it would be better to use a dictionary / hash map / array so the program would be able to identify these prefixes.

This repository holds the full list of international call vendor prefixes as one JSON object, inspired from the [WiKiPedia's webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes) and maintained by **you all**, the donors ;-)
